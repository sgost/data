You have collected a lot of data but wondering how to analyse, interpret and present the findings in an interesting and meaningful way. Here are some tips that will help you analyse your qualitative data and write it convincingly.

## Why analyse data?

"Why not just present, verbatim, the data that you collect or source? Why not let the data ‘speak for themselves’?

These raw data do not constitute the findings of the research."
