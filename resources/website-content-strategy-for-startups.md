Many startups offer really good products or services. They spend a lot of time refining the product or services to offer the best to the customer. However, they fail miserably in conveying their innovation to the world. In other words, they do not have a content strategy that will help market their product easier, better and faster.

Where to start?

**1. Talk to the reader — create a tone and personality for your website**\
Your website content reflects you and sets the tone for the readers. Your content can be cold or create a sense of warmth to your customers. If you are into B2C business, you can use some humour. The tone of the content also varies depending on the target audience — for example, you can have informal or casual content if your target is youth, the same may not work if your target is older people. So, set your tone right before you start creating the content.

**2. Brevity — good things, when short, are twice as good**\
Keep your content crisp and to the point. On the website, readers don’t read the content, they just scan the page, and if they do not find what they want they may not visit your site again. So, you should have an idea as to what the reader would expect on that page and give relevant content, in minimum words.

**3. Microcopy — the little big thing**\
The short text that tells you the character length of your password, the labels on the button you click, the popover that explain what the text field is — are few examples of microcopy. If you have an ecommerce site, the microcopy will make or break the deal. If the customer struggles to fill a form or make a payment, you will lose a customer. This is where microcopy comes to rescue.

Break your microcopy in to several section and start creating effective, crisp and consistent text that enhances the experience of your website. I will discuss this in detail in a separate blogpost

**4. SEO — give some love to the search engines**\
You need not hire an SEO expert to do this. To get started, have the right keywords on your page titles on the website. By page title, I mean the title that shows on the header of the browser. For example, if you are a software testing company, then your page title should have software testing related keywords. Followed by this, you should have relevant content on each page of your website with relevant keywords. This is enough for search engines to crawl your site.

**5. Digital Presence/Social Media — if it is not here, well it’s not anywhere**\
As a new business, you should shout online to make your presence felt. Start by taking part in conversations related to your business on Quora and LinkedIn, create your own blog and share your thoughts on your industry, create a presentation and post it on Slideshare, or a video on Youtube. Share all your content providing links on Twitter and if you are a B2C company, you should have a Facebook strategy.

Of course there will be many other ways to build your site with effective content. Share your thoughts and experience of how you built content for your startup.
